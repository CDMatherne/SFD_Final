# AMD GPU support (ROCm/HIP)
# AMD support requires the HIP-SDK to be installed https://www.amd.com/en/developer/resources/rocm-hub/hip-sdk.html
# Install cupy-rocm for AMD GPUs (replaces cupy for AMD systems)

# Note: tkinter is usually included with Python installations
# On Linux, you may need to install: sudo apt-get install python3-tk
# On macOS, tkinter should be included with Python from python.org
